      <h3>Methodology</h3>
      <div id="about-me">
        <img src="images/roman.jpg" />
      </div>
      <p>
        My name is Roman Rogowski. I've been climbing for over a decade, and I
        have a passion for breaking down and analyzing the attitudes, behaviors,
        and movements of climbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the greater joys I've experienced along my climbing journey is
        witnessing the moment a climber takes a step towards overcoming the
        "impossible."
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe such moments can be cultivated via the practice of deep
        self-inquiry. To improve as climbers—to ask more of ourselves—we must
        <i>ask more</i> of ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        As your coach, I'll help you learn how to analyze various aspects of
        your performance, how to ask yourself better questions, and how to
        discover your own unique solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this approach, I believe we can overcome any limitations that
        are standing in your way of progress. Let's do this.

      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <p><b>Can I reschedule a booking?</b></p>
      <p>
        Yes. When you confirm your booking, you'll receive a Google Calendar
        invite. Once you accept the invite, it will create a shared event on
        your personal calendar.
      </p>
      <p>
        All you need to do is move the shared event, and I will be notified that
        you've rescheduled. That's it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that if you reschedule less than 24 hours in advance, it's
        possible that I might not be able to meet at the newly proposed time.
      </p>
      <p><b>Can I cancel a booking?</b></p>
      <p>
        Yes, but please note that refunds are not available once a booking has
        been confirmed.
      </p>
      <p>
        To cancel a booking, please send me an email with a short explanation of
        the reason for cancellation.
