      <h3>Methodology</h3>
      <p>
        One of the great joys in my life is seeing the blend of excitement and
        disbelief on a climber's face when they perform a task they once thought
        was impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe these magical moments can be cultivated via the practice of
        deep self-inquiry. To improve as climbers—to ask more of ourselves—we
        must <i>ask more</i> of ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        As your coach, I'll help you learn how to analyze various aspects of
        your performance, to ask yourself better questions, and to discover your
        own unique solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this approach, I believe we can overcome any limitations that
        are standing in your way of progress!
